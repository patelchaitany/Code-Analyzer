# Fixing the "Not Found" Error with the Analyze Code Functionality

This guide outlines the steps to fix the "Not Found" error when using the analyze code functionality on your Vercel deployment.

## What Changes Were Made

1. **Added explicit `/analyze-code` endpoint in `api/index.py`:**
   - We duplicated the analyze-code endpoint directly in the Vercel serverless function
   - This ensures the endpoint is available regardless of route forwarding issues

2. **Updated the Vercel config in `vercel.json`:**
   - Added explicit methods (`POST`, `OPTIONS`) to the `/analyze-code` route
   - This helps Vercel correctly route the requests

3. **Updated the frontend API URL in `FileUploader.js`:**
   - Changed the production API URL from `/api/analyze-code` to just `/analyze-code`
   - This matches your Vercel routing configuration

## How to Test These Changes

1. **Deploy the updated code to Vercel:**
   ```
   vercel deploy
   ```

2. **Test with the included test script:**
   - Update the `API_URL` in `test_api_file_upload.py` to your Vercel URL
   - Run: `python test_api_file_upload.py`

3. **Monitor the Vercel logs:**
   - Check for any errors in the Vercel deployment logs
   - Use: `vercel logs your-project-name`

## If You Still Face Issues

1. **Try disabling route forwarding entirely:**
   - In `api/index.py`, comment out the middleware and route forwarding sections
   - Explicitly define any other endpoints you need

2. **Check Vercel function logs:**
   - The enhanced error logging we added will help identify specific issues
   - Look for detailed error messages in the Vercel function logs

3. **Test API directly with curl:**
   ```
   curl -X POST -F "file=@test_sample.py" https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app/analyze-code
   ```

## Understanding the Root Cause

The "Not Found" error was happening because:

1. The route forwarding between the Vercel serverless function and your backend app wasn't working as expected
2. The API URL in the frontend may have been incorrect for the Vercel environment
3. Vercel's serverless environment handles routes differently than a standard FastAPI deployment

By explicitly defining the endpoint and fixing the URL, we've bypassed these issues.
